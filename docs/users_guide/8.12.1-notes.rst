* In obscure scenarios, GHC now rejects programs it previously accepted, but
  with unhelpful types. For example, if (with ``-XPartialTypeSignatures``) you
  were to write ``x :: forall (f :: forall a (b :: a -> Type). b _). f _``, GHC previously
  would have accepted ``x``, but its type would have involved the mysterious ``Any``
  internal type family. Now, GHC rejects, explaining the situation.
